        <h1>My Creative Projects</h1>
        <p>During this quarantine, I have dabbled in a few art pieces. From painting on old shirts to experimenting with coffee on canvas, I have kept myself entertained indoors. Below are a few of my art projects, and I hope I can create more soon. Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>Swimming Koi Fish</h1>
        <p>I found an old thrifted shirt in my closet back at home and decided to spice it up a bit. Although not finished, this shirt sports two acrylic painted koi fish. I hope to learn embroidery soon so I can embroider "Art Chick" on the front pocket.</p>

        <h1>Encinitas in Watercolor</h1>
        <p>I would love to live in a little quaint and cozy home in Encinitas later in life. Imagine waking up and taking a stroll by the beach every morning, or even better yet, catching some waves. I'll be right by my favorite taco shop, The Taco Stand, and will eat ALL the al pastor tacos. Anyway, I decided to watercolor this home I saw in Encinitas during this quarantine. It brings me a lot of happiness. </p>

        <h1>Coffee on Canvas</h1>
        <p>One day in quarantine, I was really bored and decided to do something very spontaneous! I grabbed my cup of coffee and just poured it over a blank canvas I had laying around. After I let the coffee dry, only a faint color remained. I have yet to progress this piece. </p>
